# crimeseen

A new Flutter application.

Description: “CrimeSeen” is an android mobile app dedicated to warning users of local crimes with the ultimate goal of reducing crime rates. It allows users to report nearby illicit activities and view active crimes around the globe in the palm of their hands! Upon completion, it will be a great tool for users to avoid crime and for law enforcements to solve crime. 

Inspiration:
We want safe communities for all. The more safe, the more we are willing to explore and educate ourselves on our surroundings. In environments where we feel uncomfortable, we tend to hide ourselves. We want communities to grow and thrive and hopefully, this app is able to ease our minds so we can go explore again.

Some of the Challenges we ran into consists of:
Google maps: As our first attempt, we spent a long time trying to set up google maps and add markers on the maps. These marks represent active reports uploaded by users. 
Database: Both local database and cloud database are used. Team members spend time on connection between the front and back end. 

Future plans:
We would love to have a photo feature where users are able to take photos of the incident and are able to upload it into the app. We would like to have an authentication of the photos/incident reports provided by the users, making sure that new incidents are not fraudulent or spam keeping the app proper. 

Libraries used: cloud firestore, firebase analytics, hive, permission handler, google maps flutter, geolocator
